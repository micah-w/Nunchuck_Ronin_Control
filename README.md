# Nunchuck_Ronin_Control
    This code takes in values from a Nintendo Nunchuck and makes a DJI Ronin
    respond accordingly.

    Code modified by Micah Wagoner.

    Code based off of user "Sminkly" on the DJI Forum: https://forum.dji.com/thread-167232-1-1.html
    Code changed to overcome errors and suit needs. WiiChuck Library has been modified to remove all
    functionality for other controllers to reduce memory load. Using the original WiiChuck library
    WILL work, but may be unstable because it uses 93% of the memory. Modified version uses 52% of memory.
